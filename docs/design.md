Design Document for CKIVE

# Overall

Visit the entry point once or download the app... and once connected, always connected.

WebRTC for realtime communication and peer-to-peer and pull-n-push to stay online.

Trully distributed social network -- you set your own data policy, information priority, and pace to share or get updated

## Peer-to-peer network

Session-free data sharing (unless explicitly specified).

## All in browser (and app)



## Minimal centralization

Peer servers span across organization, coordinating on peer identification and connection on the client side.

CKIVE virtual "IP" and routing mechanism. One can have multiple IPs (?) to be reached from different routing paths.


## Maximum decentralization

Data remain where they are originally.

Users who shared (twitted) data/pages have local snapshots.

# Frontend

## Twitter like

Features to share and follow.

# Backend
